{"id":3,"text":"Tick fever is the general name given to a group of diseases that are all caused by a tick bite. But this is only a generalised term because there are many types of tick fever, all different from each other. It is however one of the most common dog diseases found in Sri Lanka. There are more than 5 types of tick fever seen in the country, but today we will only discuss the two most common ones. The two types are known as Ehrlichiosis and Babesiosis and they are caused by the parasites Ehrlichia canis and Babesia gibsoni, respectively. As you will see, they are not at all the same but both will make your pet very sick. (Cats can also get tick fever but that’s another story). Unfortunately, there is no sensitive (good) test available to detect E. canis in Sri Lanka. The most commonly used test is a blood smear. A small drop (< 0.1ml) of blood (out about 900 ml in a 10 kg dog) is examined under a microscope. If we find a parasite in this smear, your dog definitely has tick fever. The reasoning is that if even that one small drop of blood has a parasite, there are probably a lot more in your dog’s bloodstream. If the test is negative however, it just means that particular drop of blood does not show a parasite. Your dog could still have E. canis in his system (or not). Therefore, diagnosis is never based on a single finding. We depend on a combination of less specific signs and tests. The classic signs include a reduced appetite, lethargy and a blood test that shows a reduced platelet count. Sometimes an increased temperature, enlarged spleen and lymph nodes can also be seen on examination by your vet. A negative blood smear is inconclusive, unless it is clear that these clinical signs are also absent. Another type of testing is called “serology”. This tests for antibodies against the parasite. The problem is that the test won’t differentiate between a previous and current infection. If your dog has ever had tick fever in the past the test can be positive. That is, your dog may not be having E. canis at the time of testing but could still test positive. Also, in the early (acute) stage, or if for any reason your dog’s immune system is not activated and is not producing antibodies, the dog can test negative, even if he\/she is infected. This is therefore not a useful test for us in Sri Lanka. The best test is called a PCR test. A positive or negative result are both very accurate. The main disadvantages are that the results can take a few days and that it is currently not available in Sri Lanka. In any case, it is also very expensive. Ehrlichiosis can appear in 3 forms or stages, called SUBCLINICAL, ACUTE and CHRONIC. SUBCLINICAL means the pet is infected but the parasite hides in the spleen (*one of your dog’s organs that help with immunity). The dog can remain in this state for months to years and seem normal. However, a blood test may show some changes i.e. a decreased platelet count. This might only be a mild decrease. This subclinical state is very common in Sri Lanka.  Subclinical E. canis will become clinical and make your dog sick, when the dog is stressed.  When you go away for a long vacation and your pet is unhappy or stressed it can flare up. (Talk to us about how to minimise this risk.) If your pet gets any other illness, then tick fever can flare up and complicate both correct diagnosis and treatment. For example, the stress of a surgery can cause a flare up and make your pet sick, even if the surgery is done perfectly. This is why at PetVet, we always do a pre-surgery checkup that includes blood tests. We are looking, among other things, for a subclinical E.canis infection. The ACUTE form occurs 1-3 weeks after the dog is bitten by a tick. This stage is often the easiest to diagnose as well as treat. The dog will seem tired, have a poor appetite and sometimes a fever.  The vet may also see an enlarged spleen or lymph nodes*. If your pet is treated on time, he can get rid of the parasite. If treatment is delayed however, it can progress to one of the other stages. The CHRONIC form is the most serious. This is where your pet has been subclinical and then stressed so the disease is activated. Or the pet has an acute form which was not treated in time and then becomes chronic. At this stage the dog will show more serious signs. In addition to the usual signs of reduced\/no appetite, extreme lethargy and often fever, they will also show pale gums and signs of bleeding due to reduced platelets (*cells that stop bleeding by causing a clot to form). Blood tests will show a significantly reduced platelet count and sometimes, anaemia and reduced white blood cell count. There can also be unusual complications such as limping, diarrhoea, bleeding into the eyes and neurological signs such as imbalance, seizures and paresis*. Your pet will need intensive care, careful monitoring, lots of rest and patience on your part because this form takes a long time to cure.  If neglected, dogs can die from this disease. BABESIOSIS or Babesia gibsoni infection, in dogs, is often more serious than E. canis. It is also more difficult to treat.  Babesiosis can also be seen as a subclinical, acute or chronic infection. The consequences of these forms are as explained for E. canis. SUBCLINICAL cases can be benign or flare up. ACUTE cases can be very serious and CHRONIC cases are usually serious. This babesia parasite lives in the red blood cell and destroys them. As a result, it causes anaemia as its principle and most serious sign. This anaemia is the main difference from E.canis. Otherwise, similarly to E. canis, you will see reduced appetite, tiredness, enlarged spleen and lymph nodes, increased temperature and in some cases neurological signs.  This disease often requires a blood transfusion. This gives us and your pet the time to effectively deal with the illness.  Diagnosis is similar, with the primary test in Sri Lanka being the examination of a blood smear. Again, a blood smear test is diagnostic if positive but does not give any information if negative. In other words, it may be inconclusive if negative. Antibody tests as mentioned are not useful. There is a PCR test available and this is great to have but again, expensive. Once your dog is infected by the bacteria it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to begin to show. The symptoms of tick fever in dogs are somewhat vague and extremely varied in nature making a diagnosis of tick fever challenging in some cases. Some of the most common symptoms of tick fever in dogs include  Fever up to 105°F (40.5°C) Loss of appetite Enlarged lymph nodes Inflammation of joints Vomiting and diarrhea Facial or limb swelling Coughing Breathing difficulties Abdominal pain. In more severe cases dogs may exhibit round, purplish-red spots inside of the eyelids and mouth caused by bleeding below the surface. About 30% of dogs will experience central nervous system symptoms such as  Altered mental states Impaired balance Painful spinal sensitivity. When diagnosing tick fever in dogs, your vet will examine your pup for signs of the symptoms listed above and may recommend diagnostic testing such as blood tests, urinalysis and x-rays. Blood test results that point to tick fever include low platelet count, anemia, and abnormal white blood cell counts. Other diagnostic tests can be useful in detecting low protein levels, abnormal calcium levels, electrolyte abnormalities, and abnormal liver or kidney values which point towards a diagnosis of tick fever. If your vet believes that your pup has tick fever they may prescribe a round of antibiotics even before test results have come back. This is because any delay in treatment could cause symptoms to become increasingly severe and possibly even fatal. Most dogs respond to antibiotic treatment within 24 to 48 hours, although dogs with severe cases of the disease may not respond at all to treatment. The most common antibiotics used to treat tick fever in dogs include tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. In some cases, your vet may also recommend a blood transfusion to treat anemia or other supportive therapies. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a disease of humans and dogs that is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. (Rickettsiae are a specialized type of bacteria that live only inside other cells.) The spotted-fever group of organisms is found worldwide, but the closely related organisms within this group that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever are only found in certain geographic areas of North, South, and Central America. They are often transmitted through the bites of infected ticks. In the United States, the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick are considered the most important transmission agents for Rickettsia rickettsii. The brown dog tick also transmits the disease in some parts of the country (including Arizona) and in other countries. Direct transmission from dogs to humans has not been reported. Humans can become infected following contact with tick blood and lymph fluids or excretions during the removal of engorged ticks from their pets or themselves. Human infections usually involve the transfer of tick fluids through broken skin or through the eyes. Dogs are highly susceptible to infection. Early signs may include fever (up to 105°F [40.5°C]), loss of appetite, enlargement of the lymph nodes, inflammation of several joints, coughing or difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, and swelling of the face or extremities. In severe cases, unraised, perfectly round, purplish red spots may be seen on the linings of the eyelids and mouth. These spots are caused by bleeding below the surfaces of these tissues. Signs of nervous system involvement, such as altered mental states, impaired balance, and increased painful spinal sensitivity from a normally painless touch, may be seen. Between 1% and 10% of dogs with Rocky Mountain spotted fever die from the disease. Blood tests that assess antibody levels are used to diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If a veterinarian suspects the disease, antibiotic treatment is usually started immediately without waiting for blood test results. Any delay in treatment may increase the chances of a severe or fatal infection. Depending on the severity of infection, supportive care for dehydration and bleeding may be necessary. The most important preventive steps are those that control ticks, the most common source of the disease. Keeping your dog away from areas known to harbor ticks is a step you can take. Preventive medications that will keep your dog from being infested with ticks are also available from your veterinarian. Any ticks found on your dog should be promptly and properly removed to prevent the spread of disease. Remove any ticks by using fine-pointed tweezers to grasp the head of the tick (right where it enters the skin). Pull the tick straight off, making sure not to grasp or squeeze its body. If there are multiple ticks, it may be best to have your veterinarian remove them and examine your dog. It is important to remember that contact with fluids and excretions from infected ticks can spread the disease to people. Tick fever can cause a number of different symptoms in dogs. It may take up to 14 days after your dog contracts the germs for symptoms to appear. The symptoms of canine tick fever are incredibly diverse and hazy in nature, making a diagnosis of tick fever difficult in some circumstances. The following are a few of the most typical canine tick fever symptoms  Up to 105°F (40.5°C) of fever Reduced appetite An increase in lymph nodes Joint inflammation diarrhea and vomiting body or facial edema Coughing Breathing problems Continent pain. Tick fever can also cause anemia and bleeding. In severe cases, tick fever can be fatal.","label":[[0,10,"DISEASE"],[164,174,"DISEASE"],[424,451,"DISEASE"],[649,654,"DISEASE"],[979,990,"DISEASE"],[1431,1447,"SYMPTOM"],[1449,1457,"SYMPTOM"],[1464,1474,"SYMPTOM"],[1762,1770,"SYMPTOM"],[1937,1947,"DISEASE"],[3293,3303,"SYMPTOM"],[4050,4057,"DISEASE"],[4701,4708,"SYMPTOM"],[4710,4719,"SYMPTOM"],[4721,4743,"SYMPTOM"],[5337,5344,"DISEASE"],[5627,5636,"SYMPTOM"],[5638,5653,"SYMPTOM"],[5671,5692,"SYMPTOM"],[6506,6516,"DISEASE"],[6561,6577,"SYMPTOM"],[6578,6598,"SYMPTOM"],[6599,6621,"SYMPTOM"],[6622,6630,"SYMPTOM"],[6635,6643,"SYMPTOM"],[6654,6667,"SYMPTOM"],[6668,6676,"SYMPTOM"],[6677,6699,"SYMPTOM"],[6700,6714,"SYMPTOM"],[7008,7018,"DISEASE"],[7212,7222,"DISEASE"],[7490,7500,"DISEASE"],[7541,7551,"DISEASE"],[8122,8150,"DISEASE"],[9270,9275,"SYMPTOM"],[9300,9316,"SYMPTOM"],[9318,9348,"SYMPTOM"],[9350,9380,"SYMPTOM"],[9382,9390,"SYMPTOM"],[9394,9417,"SYMPTOM"],[9419,9433,"SYMPTOM"],[9435,9443,"SYMPTOM"],[9448,9456,"SYMPTOM"],[9462,9482,"SYMPTOM"],[9486,9497,"SYMPTOM"],[9891,9919,"DISEASE"],[10003,10031,"DISEASE"],[11167,11177,"DISEASE"],[11336,11346,"DISEASE"],[11412,11422,"DISEASE"],[11664,11672,"SYMPTOM"],[11673,11691,"SYMPTOM"],[11772,11782,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4,"text":"Our pets can fracture bones in either their front or back legs. The front leg consists of the radius and ulna (with the radius being the main weight supporting bone), and the humerus (forms the elbow and shoulder). The back leg comprises of the tibia and fibula (shin), and the femur (thigh). If your canine companion has an accident and suffers a broken leg, a veterinarian will need to assess the severity and location of the break. Another name for a broken bone is a fracture. Dogs are no different than humans in that they can accidentally fracture a leg bone during times of exercise or play. Not all events lead to broken bones; legs can also be dislocated or may have smaller fractures known as hairline fractures (small crack in the bone). In many cases, a pet owner will witness the event that leads up to the fracture. Sometimes, though, our pets suffer a broken leg without us knowing it has happened. If your dog exhibits any of the symptoms below, be certain to bring him to the clinic without delay. Abnormal movement of a limb Holding the leg up Swelling in a limb Pain Whining Unwillingness or inability to walk Severe lameness Grinding or popping sounds of bone Bruising In the case of a serious trauma, there could be other critical issues that are not apparent such as internal bleeding or organ injury. Do not ponder the decision to go the veterinary hospital.There is a chance that a broken bone, contingent on the type and severity, could be life threatening. If the bone is impacting an organ or causing a part of the body to bleed, complications could quickly develop. The types of broken bones can be classified in a few ways. Incomplete or complete fracture This description means the fracture has occurred partway around the bone (incomplete) or broken through the circumference of the bone (complete). Transverse, oblique or comminuted This is a complete fracture described as transverse (straight across bone), oblique (diagonally across the bone), and comminuted (the break is in three or more pieces) Open or closed fracture If there is a wound in the skin where the fracture is located, it is called 'open'.  If there is no visible wound, it is called 'closed'. A break in a dog’s leg can occur when you least expect it. Your dog will be in pain and may be feeling very anxious and frightened. Remain calm as you prepare for the trip to the clinic so as not to upset or excite your dog, which could result in making the situation worse. Vehicular trauma Play and exercise Sports Underlying disease Diet (too much phosphorus or Vitamin A, not enough calcium) Bone cancer Inherited collagen defect (weakens bones) Falls Age (young bones are not fully formed) Breed (toy breeds have tiny bones, easier to break). Transport your dog as carefully as possible to the clinic. If the leg break is the result of a vehicular accident, be aware that your pet could have internal injuries. If another family member is at home, have them accompany you, so there is an extra person available in the seat beside your dog, to provide comfort and to keep him from trying to move. Depending on the type of break, you may choose to fashion a splint of sorts to keep the break still. Do not attempt to correct the position of the limb. When you reach the clinic, the veterinary team will first concentrate on stabilising your pet’s vital signs if needed. The following steps and tools will be used for diagnosis. Intravenous will be initiated if your dog requires it, to begin the use of fluids, pain medication or antibiotics A urinary catheter may be inserted, so your dog does not feel the need to stand to urinate, and so he does not stress about not being able to pass urine The veterinarian will check for organ injury or other signs of trauma Blood work may be done Your dog will most likely be sedated so the veterinary team can do radiographs of the body (leg views to check for the break, abdominal and chest views to verify that the heart and lungs are without complications) An abdominal ultrasound will be done if needed for additional organ analysis. Once your furry family member has been stabilised, the fracture will be attended to. Immobilizing the break in order to ease pain and prevent further damage to muscles, blood vessel and nerves are key. Avoiding further trauma to the break is important, too. The options will be of a non-surgical or surgical nature. In the case of a simple, closed fracture, a splint or cast may be all that is required for healing. With a cast or splint, emphasis must be placed on keeping the injured area, and it’s covering clean and dry. Other surgical fixation methods (like metal devices) may be a better choice. The decision will depend on your dog’s age, your home environment (are you home with your dog most of the time?), and your financial options in regards to the method of treatment. Your veterinarian will be able to advise you best on the treatment alternatives. It is interesting to note the following points about treatment options. A cast may, at first, seem like the most economical choice for treatment However, a cast or splint requires many additional appointments due to evaluations, changes, and possible repairs or replacements The overall healing period may be longer with a cast or splint An external metal fixation device will involve pins being put through the bone to splint it, without entering the body (except for the pins) An internal fixation device will be implanted under the skin and in the bone with the use of screws, pins, wires or plates As a pet owner, you may feel uncomfortable discussing the amputation of a limb, but this is sometimes the best decision when it comes to a severely damaged leg Dogs adapt very quickly to living with three legs. The length of hospital stay will depend on the treatment. The stay may range from one day to two weeks. Home care is a very important part of the recovery process. In the case of a splint or cast, you will need to monitor carefully the condition of the bandage or covering. Looseness can slow healing, and pressure sores could develop. Prevent your dog from licking the cast or pulling on the splint. An Elizabethan collar could be the answer.  Most veterinarians recommend weekly rechecks for splints to monitor for signs of underlying problems.   In the instance of internal and external fixation devices, there may be a need for the removal of some of the metal device in the future. Your veterinarian will give you all of the information needed as to timing and requirements. No matter which treatment method was used, follow-up radiographs will be necessary for eight to twelve weeks time so that the break can be re-evaluated. In the meantime, continue the use of pain medication or antibiotics as prescribed. Do not allow your dog to jump or partake in high impact play. Walking, swimming, and wading in water are beneficial forms of exercise once your veterinarian says the time is right to begin. She may recommend professional physical therapy such as an underwater treadmill. With the guidance of your veterinary team, you may be asked to do physical therapy at home in the form of ice treatments, flexion of joints, and massage. Together, you and your veterinarian can have your pet back to walking in due time. Typical recovery length will be four to twelve weeks. The age of your dog will be a factor since younger dogs heal more quickly than older dogs do. The recovery may seem slow, but the prognosis for a broken leg can be good when care and diligence is taken.","label":[[13,27,"DISEASE"],[471,479,"DISEASE"],[867,877,"SYMPTOM"],[1015,1042,"SYMPTOM"],[1043,1061,"SYMPTOM"],[1062,1080,"SYMPTOM"],[1081,1085,"SYMPTOM"],[1086,1093,"SYMPTOM"],[1094,1107,"SYMPTOM"],[1111,1129,"SYMPTOM"],[1289,1306,"SYMPTOM"],[2048,2056,"DISEASE"],[2591,2602,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5,"text":"Canine demodicosis is a type of mange that occurs when abnormally high numbers of a mite called Demodex canis multiply on the skin. This mite is normally present in small numbers in the skin of healthy dogs, but when a dog's immune system becomes weakened, the mites can overgrow and cause disease and inflammation of the skin. It is not uncommon for nursing puppies to become infected with this eight-legged skin parasite during the first two to three days of life. The mites can be passed from the mother to the nursing puppies because the puppies have weak and underdeveloped immune systems that allow the mites to overgrow, causing occasional localized patches of hair loss, redness and scaling. However, as the puppies grow and their immune systems become stronger, they are usually able to fight off the disease on their own with little or no medical intervention. It is possible for older dogs (those four years of age or older) to develop canine demodicosis, but for them, the disease is much more serious. The infestation can be localized to a few areas of the body, or generalized, meaning that the mites are all over the body. Generalized demodicosis usually means that the dog has a serious underlying disease that is weakening the immune system, thereby making the dog susceptible to overgrowth of the Demodex mites. Demodex is a type of skin mite that has a head and eight legs extending from a long, tubular body. In the skin of healthy dogs and puppies, the mites can exist in small numbers, but when the dog’s immune system is weakened or not functioning normally, the population of mites begins to increase to the point that skin disease starts. Demodicosis can manifest itself in two forms. The first is a milder form that occurs commonly in young puppies that get the mites from their mother while nursing. The Demodex mite, which will be localized to just a few regions of the puppy’s skin, may cause hair loss, mild redness, scaling, and occasional itchiness. However, with time, the puppy’s immune system will strengthen so that it resists the mites and prevents them from overgrowing. Generalized demodicosis may occur in a dog that, as a puppy, had localized demodicosis that never went away, or in a dog that developed localized demodicosis as an adult. This form of the disease can be very serious because it usually means that another disease is causing the dog’s immune system to function poorly, allowing the mite to proliferate at an uncontrolled rate. Because the mites burrow deep into the skin, they cause irritation leading to severe inflammatory skin disease. Many times, secondary bacterial infections occur, causing severe infections that make the illness worse. The diseased skin of a dog with generalized demodicosis is often hairless, reddened, scaling and, in certain areas, will ooze a pus-filled, bloody material that forms thick crusts. There are two types of demodicosis: localized, meaning confined to a few specific areas of the skin, and generalized, in which the mites have spread all over the body. Each type has a different set of signs or symptoms. Localized demodicosis occurs most often in young puppies six months old or younger. The mites usually will appear on the front legs and face, and the effects of their presence will be fairly mild. Hair loss is a common symptom, and in the bald patches the skin may be red and scaly, and may or may not be itchy. Most cases heal without treatment and do not progress to generalized demodicosis. Generalized demodicosis is far more severe than the localized form, especially when it starts when the dog is an adult of four or five years of age. Clinical signs begin with multiple areas of hair loss, scaling, and redness. These small areas get larger and progress to affect the entire body, causing severe irritation of the skin. Secondarily, severe bacterial infections commonly occur as a result of the demodicosis. After a few months, the skin may become covered with infected, pus-filled, crusty, bloody sores. Localized demodicosis usually is passed from the mother to her nursing puppies after they are born. Generally, a puppy will clear the mite infection once its immune system strengthens. However, when a young dog is not able to rid itself of mites, or when treatment fails, the animal will continue to have the infection as an adult. Unfortunately, older dogs that have an underlying disease such as cancer or are being given medications that suppress the immune system can develop the generalized form of the disease. When the demodicosis is localized or only affects a few regions of a puppy’s skin, it will usually heal within six to eight weeks with minimal or no medical treatment. Generalized demodicosis, however, often requires a very intense and lengthy treatment plan. Thus, the underlying disease should be determined and the dog’s overall health should be improved before attempting to treat demodicosis. Sometimes in older dogs the disease cannot be cured but only controlled. Oral antibiotics are often needed for 1-2 months to treat secondary bacterial infection. Options for treatment of the demodex mites include topical therapy with weekly amitraz dips, or systemic medication with daily ivermectin or milbemycin. These potentially toxic medications should be dispensed by a veterinarian at a carefully calculated dose, and ivermectin (in the dose needed to treat demodex) should never be used in herding breed dogs such as Collies, Shelties, Australian Shepherds, Old English Sheepdogs, or Border Collies, as death can ensue A genetic test is available to screen animals for sensitivity to Ivermectin. You can find the sensitivity testhere. Regardless of therapy, treatment is continued until one month beyond a negative skin scraping (no live or dead mites), which is an average of 3-4 months. Regular rechecks with your veterinarian are important to determine need for continued therapy.Demodectic mange, also known as red mange, is a parasitic skin infection caused by mites such as Demodex canis (most common), Demodex injai, or Demodex cornei. Under the microscope, it appears cigar-shaped with eight short legs.   This type of mite is a normal inhabitant of the hair follicle, though it is usually not harmful. If the immune system is healthy, these mites cause no harm to their host. Dogs with immature or compromised immune systems that allow this mite to overgrow will develop clinical signs such as hair loss and red, scaling skin lesions.  The mite normally lives in low numbers in the hair follicles of the skin. Demodex is most often transmitted from mother to puppy while suckling milk because of the pup’s immature immune system.  Exposure of a normal, healthy dog to one with demodex is not dangerous. Demodectic mange is not contagious between other dogs as it requires a depressed immune system to develop.   Demodectic mange cannot spread from dogs to humans. Clinical signs of demodectic mange include:  Alopecia (hair loss)  Skin scaling  Bumps on the skin (papules)  Pigmentation of the skin  Thickening of the skin  Itchiness varies depending on secondary skin infections or if the lesions are localized to a certain area or are generalized over the body.    In puppies, lesions often begin around the face and head due to feeding from the mother’s teat, but lesions can be found anywhere on the body. In more severe cases of generalized demodectic mange, pain, lethargy, fever, draining wounds, and skin swelling may be noted. Ear infections are also possible if the mite invades the ear canals. Mange is most commonly diagnosed through skin scraping or hair plucking, and cytology. This is a non-invasive test that involves using a scalpel blade and scraping the skin deep enough for mild irritation or bleeding to be noted (this is necessary since demodex lives deep in the hair follicle) or simply removing hair at the root for assessment. The sample is assessed under the microscope. The presence of any mites is considered a positive result.    Some mites can be found through fecal flotation or fecal testing because the dog ingests them while licking\/chewing the skin.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can also be performed, but it can warrant false negative results and is often not necessary when diagnosis is evident.  Finally, skin biopsy may be necessary in cases where the dog is not responding to therapy or if a diagnosis undetermined with other less invasive diagnostic tests. Biopsy is sometimes considered in more severe, generalized cases of demodex. Not all cases of demodectic mange require treatment. Most cases of demodectic mange that are localized to a small region of the body will spontaneously resolve in 1-2 months with no treatment. Other cases of localized infections can be treated with topical medication such as moxidectin and imidacloprid.     If demodectic mange becomes generalized, medication is recommended for resolution of symptoms.  Miticidal treatment (oral or topical) is the most common type of therapy, including ivermectin, milbemycin, doramectin, amitraz, fluralaner (Bravecto), afoxolaner (Nexgard), sarolaner (Simparica), and lotilaner (Credelio). Dogs with MDR1 mutations should never receive ivermectin. This mutation can be determined through genetic testing.  Miticidal therapy is continued until two consecutive negative skin scraping or hair plucking tests occur.  Special shampoos containing benzoyl peroxide are often recommended as these open and flush the hair follicles to allow dip and topical treatments to penetrate more efficiently. You should discuss the risks and benefits of these medications with your veterinarian before beginning to use them.  Secondary skin infections due to inflammation can occur and require antibiotic therapy. It may be necessary to treat the skin infection before clearing the demodectic mange.  It is also recommended to stop breeding dogs with generalized demodex infections as the disease is thought to have an underlying genetic and\/or immune system cause that contributes to the overgrowth of mites. With localized demodicosis, symptoms are usually mild and affect a dog’s face, trunk, or legs. You will notice thinning hair, scaly skin, and the skin itself will appear reddish-brown and look very itchy. With generalized demodicosis, skin lesions are more widespread and may involve the entire body. Your dog may look scruffy and show signs of hair loss as well as discoloration of the skin. She may also be lethargic and have a poor appetite. In order to diagnose your dog with demodicosis, your veterinarian will take skin scrapings of the affected areas and may recommend other tests specific to your dog’s symptoms and the severity of the infestation. The treatment for demodicosis will vary depending on whether the infection is localized or generalized. Localized demodicosis often requires no treatment other than careful observation. As stated above, the good news is that, most often, localized infestations resolve themselves without treatment! Generalized demodicosis is treated with oral or topical medication depending on the individual case. In some situations, additional medications are prescribed, such as antibiotics if a secondary bacterial infection has occurred. Regularly scheduled recheck examinations and skin scrapings are needed to monitor response to therapy. Demodex are parasitic mites that cause a skin condition called demodicosis. These microscopic monsters can live in your dog’s hair follicles and oil glands. While all dogs have a small population of these little pests (disgusting, I know), those who are sick or have a compromised immune system can’t suppress the mites from spreading, and so an infestation can occur. This sometimes occurs in dogs without an obvious underlying problem. Demodicosis can be localized or generalized. Localized demodicosis infections usually occur early in life, typically in puppies between 3 and 6 months of age. This form of of the disease is usually mild and responds well to treatment. Many cases resolve spontaneously with little or no treatment, though in some dogs it progresses to the generalized form. Generalized demodicosis can also occur in older dogs and is then often secondary to an underlying disease that is suppressing the dog's immune system. Generalized demodicosis is more difficult to treat and carries a more guarded prognosis.","label":[[0,18,"DISEASE"],[96,103,"DISEASE"],[1922,1931,"SYMPTOM"],[1933,1945,"SYMPTOM"],[1947,1954,"SYMPTOM"],[1960,1980,"SYMPTOM"],[2760,2774,"SYMPTOM"],[2776,2784,"SYMPTOM"],[3407,3412,"SYMPTOM"],[6956,6964,"SYMPTOM"],[6966,6975,"SYMPTOM"],[7071,7080,"SYMPTOM"],[7411,7415,"SYMPTOM"],[7417,7425,"SYMPTOM"],[7427,7432,"SYMPTOM"],[7434,7449,"SYMPTOM"],[7455,7468,"SYMPTOM"],[8106,8113,"SYMPTOM"],[8114,8121,"SYMPTOM"],[10261,10266,"SYMPTOM"],[10472,10481,"SYMPTOM"],[10498,10506,"SYMPTOM"],[10589,10598,"SYMPTOM"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6,"text":"Canine distemper is a highly contagious virus caused by the paramyxovirus. It is seen in dogs around the world, but it can also affect ferrets, racoons, skunks, grey foxes, and many other animals.Canine distemper affects the gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, immune, and central nervous systems. Symptoms can take up to 14 days to show up after exposure. Signs and symptoms of canine distemper include Fever Nasal discharge Eye discharge Lethargy Sneezing Coughing Difficulty breathing Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Thickening of nose and foot pads Pneumonia  Skin sores Pain. Canine distemper may also cause brain inflammation and neurological symptoms, which is often confused with rabies. Neurological symptoms of canine distemper include Muscle twitching Chewing-gum fits Excessive saliva Head tilt Circling Involuntary eye movements Paralysis or partial paralysis Seizures. At first, you may not notice symptoms of canine distemper, and it can be mistaken for other viruses and infections. Your dog can get a mild or severe case and may have symptoms that only last 10 days. However, neurological symptoms may be delayed and show up months after infection. Canine distemper is caused by the paramyxovirus virus. Animals get infected from contact with infected urine, blood, saliva, or respiratory droplets. Of these, transmission usually happens through droplets. It can be spread through coughing and sneezing or contaminated food and water bowls.  Canine distemper can occur year round, but the virus is resistant to cold. The majority of cases in domestic dogs occur in the late fall and winter. Canine distemper is spread through direct contact or airborne exposure, rather like the common cold in humans. When an infected dog or wild animal coughs, sneezes, or barks, he releases aerosol droplets into the environment, infecting nearby animals and surfaces, like food and water bowls. The good news is that the virus does not last long in the environment and can be destroyed by most disinfectants. The bad news is that distemper-infected dogs can shed the virus for up to several months, putting dogs around them at risk. Dogs are not the only animals that can get distemper. Wild animals like raccoons, foxes, wolves, coyotes, skunks, ferrets, and mink can also get distemper. This means that an outbreak of distemper in the local wildlife population can put dogs at risk for catching the disease even if they do not come into contact with other dogs. Bitches can also spread the virus through the placenta to their puppies, which is one of the reasons why it is important to fully vaccinate any dog you plan to breed.Distemper dogs experience a wide range of symptoms depending on how advanced the disease is in their bodies. Once a dog becomes infected, the virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract before moving on to infect the rest of the dog’s lymphatic tissue, the respiratory tract, the GI tract, the urogenital epithelium, the central nervous system, and optic nerves. This results in two stages of symptoms. The first symptom of distemper in dogs is usually watery to pus-like discharge from his eyes, followed by fever, loss of appetite, and clear nasal discharge. Most dogs develop a fever approximately 3-to-6 days after being infected, but the initial symptoms depend on the severity of the case and how the patient reacts to it. In general, the symptoms associated with distemper in dogs during the first stages of infection are: Fever Clear nasal discharge Purulent eye discharge Lethargy Anorexia Coughing Vomiting Diarrhea Pustular dermatitis (rarely) Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. If a dog infected with distemper survives the acute stage of the illness, he may also develop hyperkeratosis of the paw pads and nose, which gives distemper the nickname “hard pad disease.” This distemper symptom causes the pads of a dog’s feet to harden and enlarge and is uncomfortable. One of the other risks associated with distemper in dogs is a secondary bacterial infection that attacks when a dog’s immune system is compromised by the distemper virus. Secondary bacterial infections can cause respiratory and GI symptoms, including: Vomiting Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Change in respiratory rate Pneumonia. Some dogs develop neurological signs as the disease progresses and attacks the central nervous system. These signs are particularly disturbing for owners. Head tilt Circling Partial or full paralysis Seizures Nystagmus (repetitive eye movements) Muscle twitching Convulsions with increased salivation and chewing motions Death. Distemper in dogs presents with some or all of these symptoms, depending on the severity of the case. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), “distemper is often fatal, and dogs that survive usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage. There is no cure for canine distemper. Veterinarians diagnose distemper through a combination of clinical signs and diagnostic tests, or through a postmortem necropsy. Once diagnosed, care is purely supportive. Veterinarians treat the diarrhea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms, prevent dehydration, and try to prevent secondary infections. Most vets recommend that dogs be hospitalized and separated from other dogs to prevent the spread of infection. The survival rate and length of infection depend on the strain of the virus and on the strength of the dog’s immune system. Some cases resolve as quickly as 10 days. Other cases may exhibit neurological symptoms for weeks and even months afterward. Initially, infected dogs will develop watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes. They then develop fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the nervous system, infected dogs develop circling behavior, head tilt, muscle twitches, convulsions with jaw chewing movements and salivation (“chewing gum fits”), seizures, and partial or complete paralysis. The virus may also cause the footpads to thicken and harden, leading to its nickname “hard pad disease.”  In wildlife, infection with canine distemper closely resembles rabies.  Distemper is often fatal, and dogs that survive usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage. As with most viral infections, there is no specific treatment. Antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin) are not effective against viruses, but do help in controlling the secondary bacterial infections that often occur with distemper. The treatment for distemper is aimed at helping reduce the intensity of signs and symptoms. This is accomplished with hospitalization to provide the patient with intensive nursing care, intravenous fluid therapy, and symptomatic treatment for the vomiting, diarrhea, cough, etc. Anti-seizure medications (example: diazepam, brand name Valium) may be required in some cases. Symptoms of distemper vary a lot, depending which organs are affected and how much resistance (immunity) a dog has. Dogs can show any combination of the following symptoms:  High temperature (fever) Runny eyes and nose (first watery then pussy) Low energy (lethargy) Loss of appetite Diarrhoea Thickened paw pads and nose (hard pad) Coughing Tremors Paralysis Fits and seizures. Distemper often starts by causing runny eyes, a cough, and diarrhoea, then after 3-4 weeks starts to cause hard pads, a hard nose and neurological signs (fits, tremors and seizures).","label":[[0,16,"DISEASE"],[60,73,"DISEASE"],[196,212,"DISEASE"],[405,410,"SYMPTOM"],[411,426,"SYMPTOM"],[427,440,"SYMPTOM"],[441,449,"SYMPTOM"],[450,458,"SYMPTOM"],[459,467,"SYMPTOM"],[468,488,"SYMPTOM"],[489,497,"SYMPTOM"],[498,506,"SYMPTOM"],[507,523,"SYMPTOM"],[524,542,"SYMPTOM"],[557,566,"DISEASE"],[585,601,"DISEASE"],[692,698,"DISEASE"],[725,741,"DISEASE"],[750,766,"SYMPTOM"],[767,784,"SYMPTOM"],[784,800,"SYMPTOM"],[801,810,"SYMPTOM"],[928,944,"DISEASE"],[1170,1186,"DISEASE"],[1204,1217,"DISEASE"],[1402,1410,"SYMPTOM"],[1415,1424,"SYMPTOM"],[1463,1479,"DISEASE"],[1612,1628,"DISEASE"],[1759,1765,"SYMPTOM"],[1767,1774,"SYMPTOM"],[2184,2193,"DISEASE"],[2638,2647,"DISEASE"],[3179,3184,"SYMPTOM"],[3186,3202,"SYMPTOM"],[3208,3229,"SYMPTOM"],[3500,3505,"SYMPTOM"],[3506,3527,"SYMPTOM"],[3528,3550,"SYMPTOM"],[3551,3559,"SYMPTOM"],[3560,3568,"SYMPTOM"],[3569,3577,"SYMPTOM"],[3578,3586,"SYMPTOM"],[3587,3595,"SYMPTOM"],[3596,3615,"SYMPTOM"],[3815,3824,"DISEASE"],[4111,4120,"DISEASE"],[4209,4217,"SYMPTOM"],[4218,4226,"SYMPTOM"],[4227,4247,"SYMPTOM"],[4248,4274,"SYMPTOM"],[4275,4284,"SYMPTOM"],[4441,4450,"SYMPTOM"],[4451,4485,"SYMPTOM"],[4486,4504,"SYMPTOM"],[4532,4548,"SYMPTOM"],[4782,4791,"DISEASE"],[4910,4926,"DISEASE"],[4951,4960,"DISEASE"],[5124,5132,"SYMPTOM"],[5134,5142,"SYMPTOM"],[5171,5190,"SYMPTOM"],[5696,5701,"SYMPTOM"],[5703,5718,"SYMPTOM"],[5720,5728,"SYMPTOM"],[5730,5738,"SYMPTOM"],[5740,5756,"SYMPTOM"],[5762,5770,"SYMPTOM"],[5854,5863,"SYMPTOM"],[5865,5880,"SYMPTOM"],[5925,5935,"SYMPTOM"],[5992,6001,"SYMPTOM"],[6181,6190,"DISEASE"],[6514,6523,"DISEASE"],[6543,6552,"DISEASE"],[6772,6780,"SYMPTOM"],[6782,6790,"SYMPTOM"],[6792,6797,"SYMPTOM"],[6911,6920,"DISEASE"],[7091,7096,"DISEASE"],[7156,7164,"SYMPTOM"],[7166,7182,"SYMPTOM"],[7183,7192,"SYMPTOM"],[7193,7211,"SYMPTOM"],[7278,7287,"DISEASE"],[7326,7331,"SYMPTOM"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7,"text":"Seizures are one of the most frequently reported neurological conditions in dogs. A seizure may also be called a convulsion or fit, referring to a temporary involuntary disturbance of normal brain function that is usually accompanied by uncontrollable muscle activity. Epilepsy is a term used to describe repeated episodes of seizures. With epilepsy, the seizures can be single or may occur in clusters and they can be infrequent and unpredictable or may occur at regular intervals. There are many causes of seizures. Idiopathic epilepsy, the most common cause of seizures in the dog, is an inherited disorder, but its exact cause is unknown. Other causes include liver disease, kidney failure, brain tumors, brain trauma, and toxins. Seizures often occur at times of changing brain activity, such as during excitement or feeding or as the dog is falling asleep or waking up. Affected dogs can appear completely normal between seizures. Seizures consist of three components The pre-ictal phase (aura) is a period of altered behavior in which a dog may hide, appear nervous, or seek out her owner. She may be restless, nervous, whining, shaking, or salivating. This may last a few seconds to a few hours. This period precedes the seizure activity as if the dog senses that something is about to occur. The ictal phase can last from a few seconds to several minutes and can vary in appearance. The ictal phase can range from mild changes in mental awareness, such as a dazed look, mild shaking, staring aimlessly, and licking lips, to a complete loss of consciousness and body function. If the dog experiences a grand mal, or full-blown seizure with loss of consciousness, all the muscles of the body move spastically and erratically. The dog usually falls over on her side and paddles her legs while seeming to be otherwise paralyzed. The head will often be drawn backward. Urination, defecation, and salivation may occur. If the seizure has not stopped within five minutes, the dog is said to be in status epilepticus or prolonged seizure (see below).  During the post-ictal phase or the period immediately after the end of the seizure, there is confusion, disorientation, salivation, pacing, restlessness, and\/or temporary blindness. There is no direct correlation between the severity of the seizure and the duration of the post-ictal phase. Despite the dramatic and violent appearance of a seizure, seizures are not painful, although your dog may feel confused and might panic. Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not swallow their tongues during a seizure. If you put your fingers or an object into her mouth, you will not help your pet and run a high risk of being bitten very badly or injuring your dog. The important thing is to keep your dog from falling or hurting herself by knocking objects onto herself. If she is on the ground, there is little chance of harm occurring. After your dog has a seizure, your veterinarian will begin by taking a thorough history, concentrating on possible exposures to poisonous or hallucinogenic substances or any history of head trauma. Your veterinarian will also perform a physical examination, blood and urine tests, and, sometimes, an electrocardiogram (ECG). These tests rule out disorders of the liver, kidneys, heart, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. A heartworm test is performed if your dog is not taking heartworm preventative monthly. If these tests are normal and there is no exposure to poison or recent trauma, further diagnostics may be recommended depending on the severity and frequency of the seizures. Occasional seizures (less frequently than once a month) are not as worrisome but they can become more frequent or more severe. If this is the case, a spinal fluid (CSF) analysis may be performed. Depending on availability at a referral center or teaching hospital, specialized techniques, such as a CT scan or MRI, may also be performed to look directly at the structure of the brain.Treatment usually begins after a dog has: More than one seizure per month,  Clusters of seizures where one seizure is immediately followed by another, or Grand mal seizures that are severe or prolonged in duration. The two most commonly used medications to treat seizures in dogs are phenobarbital and potassium bromide. Research into the use of other anticonvulsants is ongoing, and newer anticonvulsants, such as zonisamide (Zonegran®) and levetiracetam (Keppra®), are becoming more popular. Combination therapy is often used for dogs that respond poorly to standard treatments.There are three types of dog seizures, generally classified by researchers as focal (partial) seizures, generalized (grand mal) seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalization. Grand mal seizures in dogs affect both sides of the brain and the entire body. Grand mal seizures can look like involuntary jerking or twitching in all four of the animal’s limbs and include loss of consciousness. A partial seizure in dogs affects only a small part of the brain and can manifest a couple different ways, but will typically progress to grand mal seizures throughout the dog’s lifetime. When a dog is having a partial seizure, only one limb, side of the body, or just the face will be affected.Once the seizure(s) begin, the dog will fall on its side, become stiff, chomp its jaw, salivate profusely, urinate, defecate, vocalize, and\/or paddle with all four limbs. These seizure activities generally last between 30 and 90 seconds. Behavior following the seizure is known as postictal behavior, and includes periods of confusion and disorientation, aimless wandering, compulsive behavior, blindness, pacing, increased thirst (polydipsia) and increased appetite (polyphagia). Recovery following the seizure may be immediate, or it can take up to 24 hours. Generally, the younger the dog is, the more severe the epilepsy will be. As a rule, when onset is before age 2, the condition responds positively to medication. The more seizures a dog has, the more likely there is to be damage among the neurons in the brain, and the more likely the animal is to seize again.Signs of an impending seizure may include a period of warning, an altered mental state where the animal will experience what is called an aura or focal onset. During this time a dog may appear worried, dazed, stressed, or frightened. It may experience visual disturbances, hide, or seek help and attention from its owner. The dog may experience contractions in its limbs or in its muscles, and may have difficulty controlling urination and bowel movements. Seizures most often occur while the dog is resting or asleep, often at night or in early morning. In addition, most dogs recover by the time you bring the dog to the veterinarian for examination.Epilepsy is a coverall term used to describe brain disorders that are characterized by recurrent and\/or recurring seizures. There are several different types of epilepsy that can affect dogs, so it helps to understand the different vocabulary associated with each. Idiopathic epilepsy describes a form of epilepsy that does not have an identifiable underlying cause. However, idiopathic epilepsy is often characterized by structural brain lesions and is found more often in male dogs. If left untreated, the seizures may become more severe and frequent. Symptomatic epilepsy is used to describe primary epilepsy resulting in structural lesions or damage to the brain’s structure. Probably symptomatic epilepsy is used to describe suspected symptomatic epilepsy, where a dog has recurrent seizures, but where no lesions or brain damage is apparent. Cluster seizure describes any situation where an animal has more than one seizure in consecutive 24-hour periods. Dogs with established epilepsy can have cluster seizures at regular intervals of one to four weeks. This is particularly evident in large-breed dogs. Status epilepticus involves constant seizures, or activity involving brief periods where there is inactivity, but not complete relief from seizure activity.","label":[[0,8,"DISEASE"],[84,91,"DISEASE"],[508,516,"DISEASE"],[518,528,"DISEASE"],[529,537,"DISEASE"],[564,572,"DISEASE"],[695,707,"DISEASE"],[709,721,"DISEASE"],[735,743,"DISEASE"],[937,945,"DISEASE"],[1108,1116,"SYMPTOM"],[1136,1143,"SYMPTOM"],[1148,1158,"SYMPTOM"],[1467,1477,"SYMPTOM"],[1479,1491,"SYMPTOM"],[1493,1510,"SYMPTOM"],[1516,1528,"SYMPTOM"],[2128,2135,"DISEASE"],[2157,2171,"SYMPTOM"],[2173,2183,"SYMPTOM"],[2185,2191,"SYMPTOM"],[2193,2205,"SYMPTOM"],[2214,2233,"SYMPTOM"],[3560,3568,"DISEASE"],[4217,4225,"DISEASE"],[5296,5301,"SYMPTOM"],[5303,5308,"SYMPTOM"],[5318,5336,"SYMPTOM"],[5338,5345,"SYMPTOM"],[5347,5355,"SYMPTOM"],[5556,5565,"SYMPTOM"],[5570,5584,"SYMPTOM"],[5626,5635,"SYMPTOM"],[5645,5661,"SYMPTOM"],[5663,5673,"SYMPTOM"],[5679,5697,"SYMPTOM"],[5699,5709,"SYMPTOM"],[6558,6566,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8,"text":"Many dog owners have learned to recognize the telltale signs of an ear infection: whining, scratching, and head shaking are often the first symptoms of the problem. Ear infections are common conditions in dogs, especially those with floppy ears such as Basset Hounds and Cocker Spaniels. An estimated 20 percent of dogs have some form of ear disease, which may affect one or both ears. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to reduce the length and severity of these episodes for your dog. There are even several over-the-counter remedies. There are three types of ear infections, known formally as otitis externa, media, and interna. The most common is otitis externa, in which inflammation affects the layer of cells lining the external portion of the ear canal. Otitis media and interna refer to infections of the middle and inner ear canal, respectively. These infections often result from the spread of infection from the external ear. Otitis media and interna can be very serious and may result in deafness, facial paralysis, and vestibular signs. That’s why it’s important to prevent infections and seek early treatment when problems arise. Some dogs show no symptoms of ear infection aside from a buildup of wax and discharge in the ear canal. But ear infections often cause significant discomfort and affected dogs may show signs such as: Head shaking Scratching at the affected ear Dark discharge Odor Redness and swelling of the ear canal Pain Itchiness Crusting or scabs in the ears. The canine ear canal is more vertical than that of a human, forming an L-shape that tends to hold in fluid. This makes dogs more prone to ear infections. Ear infections are typically caused by bacteria, yeast, or a combination of both. In puppies, ear mites can also be a source of infection. Factors that may predispose your dog to ear infections include: Moisture, which can create a prime growing environment for bacteria and yeast Allergies, which lead to ear disease in about 50 percent of dogs with allergic skin disease and 80 percent of dogs with food sensitivities Endocrine disorders, such as thyroid disease Autoimmune disorders Wax buildup Foreign bodies Injury to the ear canal Excessive cleaning. Your veterinarian will thoroughly clean your dog’s ears using a medicated ear cleanser. Your vet may also prescribe an ear cleanser and a topical medication for you to use at home. In severe cases, your vet may prescribe oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. Most uncomplicated ear infections resolve within 1–2 weeks, once appropriate treatment begins. But severe infections or those due to underlying conditions may take months to resolve, or may become chronic problems. In cases of severe chronic disease where other treatments have failed, your veterinarian may recommend surgery such as a Total Ear Canal Ablation (TECA). A TECA surgery removes the ear canal, thus removing the diseased tissue and preventing the recurrence of infection. It is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions closely and return to the veterinary hospital for any recommended recheck appointments. Lapses in your dog’s treatment may lead to the recurrence of the infection. It is especially important that you finish the full course of your dog’s medication, even if your dog appears to be getting better. Failure to finish the full course of treatment may lead to additional problems such as resistant infections. Inflammation of the middle ear structures (otitis media) is usually caused by an extension of infection from the external ear canal or by penetration of the eardrum by a foreign object. The spread of infection through the bloodstream to these areas is also possible, but it is rare. Inflammation of the middle ear may lead to inflammation of the inner ear structures (otitis interna). This can in turn lead to loss of balance and deafness. The signs of otitis media may be similar to those of otitis externa. Head shaking, ear scratching, rubbing the affected ear on the floor, and rotating the head toward the affected side are often noted. The ear is usually painful and may have a discharge and inflammatory changes in the ear canal. Inflammation of the outer ear (otitis externa) that recurs may be another sign. Because the facial and sympathetic nerves travel through the middle ear, facial nerve paralysis, constriction of the pupil of the eye, drooping of the eyelid, sinking of the eyeball into the orbital cavity, and protrusion of the third eyelid may occur on the same side as the affected ear. If otitis interna occurs at the same time, head tilt toward the affected side will be more obvious. Additionally, an animal with inflammation of the inner ear may have an overall lack of coordination severe enough to cause difficulty in rising and walking. An involuntary rhythmic movement of the eyes from side to side (called nystagmus) may also be seen with inflammation of the inner ear. If the inflammation spreads to the brain, neurologic signs can be seen. Your veterinarian may diagnose otitis media when the eardrum is ruptured, either by a foreign object or longterm inflammation. It is difficult to diagnose if the eardrum is not ruptured, which is the case more than 70% of the time. Otitis media has been found to be present in more than half of the dogs with longterm, recurrent inflammation of the external ear. Fluid in the middle ear or hardening and fibrous overgrowth of the round bone behind the ear may be detected through x-rays, computerized tomography (CT scan), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Otitis interna may be diagnosed based on similar signs with the addition of loss of balance. Examination using an otoscope and x-rays of the round bone behind the ear may confirm the presence of simultaneous middle and inner ear inflammation. Because of the possibility of hearing loss and damage to the organ of balance (vestibular apparatus), longterm antibiotics given by mouth or injection may be prescribed by your veterinarian to treat otitis media or interna. Treatment may last 3 to 6 weeks. If the eardrum is ruptured, your veterinarian will carefully clean the middle ear. Small perforations of the eardrum usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks. Any inflammation of the external ear canal will be treated at the same time. Additionally, anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed during the first week of treatment to decrease pain and inflammatory changes in nearby nerves. If your dog’s external ear is clean and normal, but the eardrum is bulging or discolored, your veterinarian may perforate the eardrum to relieve the pressure (and thus the pain) within the middle ear, to permit removal of the inflammatory discharge, and to allow for culture of the fluid for diagnosis and treatment. Antibiotics given by mouth or injection may be prescribed for 3 to 6 weeks if inflammation of the inner ear exists. In longterm otitis media, surgery may be necessary to allow for drainage and adequate resolution of the infection. Otitis media with an intact eardrum usually responds well to antibiotic therapy. However, if longterm inflammation of the inner ear exists and the eardrum is ruptured, the chances of successful treatment are reduced. If local nerve problems develop, they may continue even after the infection has been cleared. Inflammation of the inner ear usually responds well to longterm antibiotic therapy, but some neurologic problems (for example, lack of coordination, head tilt, deafness, drooping lips, or inability to blink) may persist for life. Animals recovering from inflammation of the inner ear should be given adequate time to adapt to any persistent nerve-related signs. The sooner animals can be treated, the better the prospect is for a good outcome. If you notice any of the signs indicating a possible infection or inflammation in your pet’s ears or if you notice any changes in your dog’s normal head position or movement, a checkup should be scheduled promptly. Clinical findings of otitis media include: signs of otitis externa (head shaking, exudate, inflammation of ear canal) Horner syndrome facial nerve palsy\/paralysis keratoconjunctivitis sicca decreased hearing Signs of otitis media frequently include those of otitis externa (head shaking, rubbing or scratching the infected ear, exudate in the ear canal). If the sympathetic nerves are affected, there may be signs of Horner syndrome (enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis). Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and facial nerve palsy are also possible, with exposure keratitis and corneal ulceration also potentially developing. With facial paralysis, the nasal philtrum or lip may deviate away from the affected side. These signs help to distinguish otitis media from simple otitis externa. Some owners may notice deafness due to fluid in the middle ear. Otitis media does not cause a neurologic head tilt, but patients with ear pain may hold their head to the side. In dogs, many cases of otitis media are an extension of chronic otitis externa. Cases of chronic recurrent otitis externa, especially those that recur quickly after clinical and cytologic resolution, may be due to untreated otitis media. More commonly, recurrence is because the underlying condition has not been controlled. Primary otitis media can also occur and is seen most commonly as primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). The disease may be unilateral or bilateral. These dogs will present with classic signs of otitis media but have also demonstrated guarded neck carriage, otic pruritus without otitis externa, and spontaneous vocalization. The clinical signs also overlap with syringomyelia, which is more common in CKCSs. There does not seem to be a sex predilection for PSOM in CKCSs, but age at presentation is typically 3–7 years. Primary secretory otitis media has also been reported in other small bracheocephalic breeds. Otitis media is less common in cats than dogs but does occur. Cats with otitis frequently may have a history of respiratory disease and\/or inflammatory polyps. Less commonly, they can develop otitis media as an extension of otitis externa. Otitis media can also occur in large animals, including ruminants, horses, pigs, and camelids. Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly recognized as a cause of otitis media, respiratory disease, arthritis, mastitis, and other diseases in cattle. Otitis media associated with M bovis occurs in dairy and beef calves. Affected calves may be febrile, anorectic, develop ear droop\/pain, exhibit head shaking, and develop other signs of facial nerve paralysis. Unilateral otitis media is more common, but bilateral disease can occur. Otitis media is uncommon in horses, but severe otitis media\/interna can result in fusion and fracture of the tympanohyoid joint; extension of the fracture line to the calvarium can lead to intracranial spread of infection or cause hematoma and death. Diagnosis of otitis media\/interna begins with a complete history, physical examination identifying applicable clinical signs, and, when possible, otoscopic examination confirming a bulging\/abnormal tympanic membrane. Otoscopic evaluation of the tympanic membrane may be limited due to stenosis, anatomy of the ear canal, presence of exudate, or animal or environmental limitations. Abnormal tympanic membranes may thicken, become opaque, rupture, or bulge. The pars flaccida is located on the dorsal aspect of the tympanic membrane and may bulge due to increased pressure from air, fluid, or soft tissue. However, the tympanic membrane may look normal or intact in some cases of otitis media, and bulging caused by air can be found in some normal animals. Video otoscopy may help to better visualize the tympanic membrane, but viewing the middle ear is difficult without a small arthroscope. In dogs, otitis media is reported most commonly in patients with chronic otitis externa (up to 80%). Bilateral disease is not uncommon. Primary and secondary causes and factors of otitis externa can lead to otitis media. Diagnosis can be challenging, because the tympanic membrane can be intact and appear normal. Palpation of the tympanic membrane with a blunt instrument is not an accurate method of determining the patency of the tympanic membrane. Advanced imaging techniques (CT or MRI) are more sensitive than routine radiographs. On CT\/MRI, changes include thickening, sclerosis and lysis of the wall of the bulla, as well as the bulla itself filled with fluid\/soft tissue material. In large animals, otitis media and interna are presumptively diagnosed based on history and clinical signs. A history of bottle feeding or feeding of contaminated milk to neonates, concurrent or previous respiratory disease, chronic ear infection, or aural foreign body, in conjunction with typical signs of otitis media\/interna, should prompt examination of the ear canal. Radiography can detect osseous changes in the tympanic bulla and fluid in the tympanic cavity if appropriate positioning and techniques are used. However, CT and MRI are more sensitive and are the preferred methods when feasible. Fluid in the bullae has also been found in head CTs of dogs with no history or clinical signs of otitis externa and media, however, so diagnosis may not be simple. In some cases, diagnosis is made only at necropsy, using special techniques to expose the tympanic region. Diagnosis of clinical otitis media\/interna in one ear should always prompt examination of the other ear to determine whether subclinical otitis is present. Treatment of otitis media\/interna is most successful when started early in the course of the disease. If the case is acute in a dog, then special consideration should be given to evaluation for a foreign body (plant awn, fox tail) or iatrogenic rupture of the eardrum, possibly secondary to aggressive cleaning. Chronic cases are often refractory to treatment or recur after apparent remission. Because dogs with otitis media often have a chronic history of recurrent bacterial otitis externa, samples of exudate from the middle ear should be taken for cytology and bacterial culture. To ensure the sample is taken from the middle ear (and not the external ear which is more likely to be contaminated), use of a handheld or video otoscope with a biopsy channel is preferred. If the tympanic membrane is intact, a myringotomy can be performed using a sterile, rigid polypropylene catheter cut at a 60-degree angle, a long spinal needle, a curette, or even a CO2 laser. The membrane should be punctured at the 5–7 o'clock position to avoid the blood supply of the tympanic membrane, which is more dorsal. It is important to maintain the vessels to allow for healing and regrowth of the tympanic membrane. Fluid and exudate can then be removed aseptically from the middle ear using a catheter, and that sample can be submitted for culture to select an appropriate systemic antibiotic. After sample collection, the middle ear should be flushed copiously with sterile saline. The tympanic cavity in the cat is divided by a septum, which may make treatment more challenging. Because the eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the oral cavity, these patients should always be under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube, with the cranial aspect of the body tilted down to allow flow of fluid out of the mouth (preventing aspiration). If general anesthesia is not possible the procedure can be done under heavy sedation, but this is less safe. Some patients may have worsening of clinical signs acutely after flushing of the middle ear. Symptoms of an ear infection include: Head shaking Face\/head rubbing (often along the ground) Itchy\/painful ear(s) Redness, swelling, heat A smelly or pussy discharge An aural haematoma (swelling in the ear flap) Scabs and crusting in the ear and side of their face. Middle and inner ear infections also often cause: A head tilt to one side Loss of balance Vomiting Partial deafness. Infection of the external ear canal (outer ear infection) is called otitis externa and is one of the most common types of infections seen in dogs. Some breeds, particularly those with large, floppy or hairy ears like Cocker Spaniels, Miniature Poodles, or Old English Sheepdogs, appear to be more prone to ear infections, but ear infections may occur in any breed. There are several kinds of bacteria and at least one type of fungus that commonly cause ear infections. Without knowing the specific kind of infection present, it is not possible to know which medication to use. In some cases, the problem is a foreign body, a polyp, or a tumor. Treatment with medication alone will not resolve these problems. It is important that your dog be examined to ensure that the eardrum is intact. Administration of certain medications can result in loss of hearing if the eardrum is ruptured. This can only be detected by a thorough ear examination by your veterinarian. Ear infections are painful. Many dogs will shake their head and scratch their ears trying to relieve the discomfort. The ears often become red and inflamed and develop an offensive odor. A black or yellowish discharge commonly occurs. In chronic cases the ears may appear crusty or thickened and the ear canals often become narrowed (stenotic) due to the chronic inflammation.","label":[[67,80,"DISEASE"],[82,89,"SYMPTOM"],[91,101,"SYMPTOM"],[107,119,"SYMPTOM"],[338,349,"DISEASE"],[1352,1375,"SYMPTOM"],[1396,1410,"SYMPTOM"],[1411,1415,"SYMPTOM"],[1416,1423,"SYMPTOM"],[1428,1453,"SYMPTOM"],[1459,1468,"SYMPTOM"],[1469,1477,"SYMPTOM"],[1481,1498,"SYMPTOM"],[1654,1668,"DISEASE"],[2074,2093,"DISEASE"],[2102,2110,"DISEASE"],[2119,2139,"DISEASE"],[3960,3970,"SYMPTOM"],[3972,3979,"SYMPTOM"],[4409,4431,"SYMPTOM"],[7431,7451,"SYMPTOM"],[7453,7462,"SYMPTOM"],[7464,7472,"SYMPTOM"],[7474,7487,"SYMPTOM"],[7492,7510,"SYMPTOM"],[8015,8029,"SYMPTOM"],[8031,8043,"SYMPTOM"],[8221,8235,"SYMPTOM"],[8251,8258,"SYMPTOM"],[8262,8289,"SYMPTOM"],[9136,9148,"SYMPTOM"],[15598,15615,"SYMPTOM"],[15616,15628,"SYMPTOM"],[15879,15888,"SYMPTOM"],[15901,15916,"SYMPTOM"],[15917,15925,"SYMPTOM"],[16581,16586,"DISEASE"],[16907,16921,"DISEASE"],[16950,16966,"SYMPTOM"],[16971,16989,"SYMPTOM"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9,"text":"‘Autoimmune’ or ‘immune mediated’ conditions are caused by a fault in the immune system that causes the body to attack and destroy normal, healthy body cells. Immune mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is an autoimmune condition that causes the body to destroy its own red blood cells. These red blood cells are essential because they carry oxygen round the body. IMHA is very serious, often leads to severe anaemia, and can be fatal if left untreated. Some dog’s develop IMHA slowly and have vague symptoms that get worse over time, but in most cases, IMHA develops rapidly and causes symptoms very suddenly. IMHA can affect any dog, at any time but appears to be most common in middle age dogs, especially in certain breeds such as cocker spaniels.Pale gums (white, yellow or grey) Low energy (lethargy) Reduced appetite Weakness Collapse Jaundiced skin (yellow colour) Fast breathing Unexplained bleeding.To diagnose IMHA, your vet will need to examine your dog and run some blood tests to see if they are anaemic (low in red blood cells). If your dog has IMHA, they will need treatment to stabilise them and stop their red blood cells from being destroyed. It’s likely that your dog will need to stay in the veterinary hospital for intensive care until they have started to recover. Treatment for IMHA often includes: Steroids and other immunosuppressant drugs – to stop the body attacking its own red blood cells and allow it to replace the cells it's already destroyed. Blood transfusion – if your dog is severely anaemic, they might need a blood transfusion to save their life. A fluid drip – to keep your dog hydrated, and protect their organs while they recover. Oxygen – if your dog is severely anaemic, oxygen might be necessary to help their remaining blood cells carry as much as possible around the body. The signs that a patient shows vary depending on the severity of the disease. Some dogs and cats suffer acute severe disease and can present collapsed and unable to stand. Their gums are often very pale and you may also notice a yellow tinge in their eyes, mouth or skin. This is due to staining of the mucous membranes or skin with bilirubin which gets released into the circulation when large numbers of red blood cells are destroyed. The patient may be breathing fast due to either the anaemia, or the formation of blood clots in the lungs, which is a common complication in patients with IMHA. Sometimes the disease is not as severe and the signs may be milder (lethargy). IMHA in dogs and cats can be triggered by different factors including infectious organisms, tumours and even drugs. It is therefore extremely important to inform your vet of any medication that your pet has recently received. Investigations will then be recommended to make sure that there is not an underlying disease present. When a cause is not found, the disease is designated idiopathic (aka primary) IMHA; this means that without an obvious underlying trigger, your pet’s immune system has started destroying its own red blood cells.A diagnosis of IMHA in dogs and cats can often be made based on the clinical signs, blood tests and examination of a blood smear. Other tests should then be performed to differentiate primary IMHA from that triggered by other diseases (tumours, infections, etc). This is extremely important as the treatment of these conditions is often very different to that of primary IMHA. An incorrect diagnosis could lead to poor treatment response and even death. Additional tests which may be carried out include X-rays, abdominal ultrasound, serological tests to check for infectious organisms or, occasionally, bone marrow biopsies. If an underlying disease is present, this should be treated, since successful treatment of the underlying trigger often leads to resolution of IMHA. In cases of idiopathic or primary IMHA in dogs and cats (where a clear cause is not present), steroids are given to suppress the immune system. Other drugs such as azathioprine or ciclosporin are sometimes used in conjunction with steroids, particularly in difficult or severe cases (or as alternative sole treatment if steroids are not well tolerated). Some pets will require blood transfusions to replace red blood cells, however, the benefits are sometimes short-lived as the transfused red blood cells may also be destroyed by the immune system (hence the requirement to combine with immunosuppressive therapy). Your vet may also advise using heparin or anti-platelet drugs to prevent the risk of clot formation.The prognosis for IMHA in dogs and cats is very variable and depends on the severity of the disease and the presence of an underlying cause. In recent years there has been some research into new drugs and massive improvement in the care and monitoring of these patients. However, despite all efforts, sadly some patients succumb to the disease. The main risk of death is within the first few days\/weeks of treatment. The prognosis for dogs and cats that respond to treatment and are discharged from hospital is generally good although some may require long term treatment.","label":[[1,11,"DISEASE"],[17,32,"DISEASE"],[159,193,"DISEASE"],[195,199,"DISEASE"],[471,475,"DISEASE"],[749,758,"SYMPTOM"],[783,793,"SYMPTOM"],[795,803,"SYMPTOM"],[805,821,"SYMPTOM"],[822,830,"SYMPTOM"],[831,854,"SYMPTOM"],[871,885,"SYMPTOM"],[886,906,"SYMPTOM"],[919,923,"DISEASE"],[2274,2288,"SYMPTOM"],[2410,2414,"DISEASE"],[2484,2492,"SYMPTOM"],[2901,2905,"DISEASE"],[3270,3277,"DISEASE"],[3279,3289,"DISEASE"],[4543,4547,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":10,"text":"The canine parvovirus (CPV) infection, also referred to as Parvo, is a highly contagious viral illness that affects dogs, particularly in puppies that are between six weeks and six months old. The virus takes on two different forms: intestinal, which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and lack of appetite; and cardiac (less common), an often deadly attack on the heart muscles of very young puppies. Vaccines can prevent this infection, but if left untreated, the mortality rate is 91% . Symptoms Dogs that develop the disease tend to show symptoms of the illness within 3 to 7 days. The major symptoms of Parvo include severe, bloody diarrhea  lethargy anorexia Fever  vomiting severe weight loss dehydration red, inflamed tissue around the eyes and mouth rapid heart beat pain or discomfort low body temperature.There are a variety of risk factors for Parvo, but the virus is most commonly transmitted either by direct contact with an infected dog, or indirectly, by the fecal-oral route. There is evidence that the virus can live in ground soil for up to a year. Goals of parvo treatment include keeping the pet hydrated, controlling nausea and vomiting, preventing secondary bacterial infections and controlling abdominal pain. Hospitalization is needed so medications and fluids can be given through injections. Parvo pets have a very difficult time keeping oral medications, food and water down so successful home treatment is extremely difficult to achieve. Pets can be hospitalized up to 7 days in some cases but in most cases 3-5 days. The survival rate for hospitalized parvo dogs is approximately 90%. Pets are able to go home when they are hydrated, no longer vomiting and are eating willingly. Pets with parvo can continue to shed the disease for up to a month after recovery so it is important to keep them away from public places and other pets during this time. They should get vaccinated for parvo about 3-4 weeks after treatment is complete.According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the best way to prevent parvovirus is through good hygiene and vaccination. Make sure to get your puppies vaccinated, and be sure your adult dogs are kept up-to-date on their parvovirus vaccination. Puppies have immunity from their mothers early in life, but should receive their first vaccine between 6 and 8 weeks of age (after weaning), and then two boosters at three-week intervals. Until a puppy has received its complete series of vaccinations, pet owners should use caution when bringing their pet to places where young puppies or dogs with unknown vaccination histories congregate. This includes pet-friendly restaurants, popular hiking trails, boarding facilities, and especially dog parks. Puppies should be sequestered until three to four weeks after their third vaccine—this is when full immunity is achieved. It is also important to note that fully-vaccinated dogs have become sick with Parvo, so always be aware of possible symptoms. Canine parvovirus is a highly contagious virus that can affect all dogs, but unvaccinated dogs and puppies younger than four months old are the most at risk. Dogs that are ill from canine parvovirus infection are often said to have \"parvo.\" The virus affects dogs' gastrointestinal tracts and is spread by direct dog-to-dog contact and contact with contaminated feces (stool), environments, or people. The virus can also contaminate kennel surfaces, food and water bowls, collars and leashes, and the hands and clothing of people who handle infected dogs. It is resistant to heat, cold, humidity, and drying, and can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Even trace amounts of feces from an infected dog may harbor the virus and infect other dogs that come into the infected environment. The virus is readily transmitted from place to place on the hair or feet of dogs or via contaminated cages, shoes, or other objects. Some of the signs of parvovirus include lethargy; loss of appetite; abdominal pain and bloating; fever or low body temperature (hypothermia); vomiting; and severe, often bloody, diarrhea. Persistent vomiting and diarrhea can cause rapid dehydration, and damage to the intestines and immune system can cause septic shock. Parvovirus infection is often suspected based on the dog's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Fecal testing can confirm the diagnosis. No specific drug is available that will kill the virus in infected dogs, and treatment is intended to support the dog's body systems until the dog's immune system can fight off the viral infection. Treatment should be started immediately and consists primarily of intensive care efforts to combat dehydration by replacing electrolyte, protein and fluid losses, controlling vomiting and diarrhea, and preventing secondary infections. Sick dogs should be kept warm and receive good nursing care. When a dog develops parvo, treatment can be very expensive, and the dog may die despite aggressive treatment. Early recognition and aggressive treatment are very important in successful outcomes. With proper treatment, survival rates can approach 90%. Since parvovirus is highly contagious, isolation of infected dogs is necessary to minimize spread of infection. Proper cleaning and disinfection of contaminated kennels and other areas where infected dogs are (or have been) housed is essential to control the spread of parvovirus. The virus is not easily killed, so consult your veterinarian for specific guidance on cleaning and disinfecting agents. Young puppies are very susceptible to infection, particularly because the natural immunity provided in their mothers' milk may wear off before the puppies' own immune systems are mature enough to fight off infection. If a puppy is exposed to canine parvovirus during this gap in protection, it may become ill. An additional concern is that immunity provided by a mother's milk may interfere with an effective response to vaccination. This means even vaccinated puppies may occasionally be infected by parvovirus and develop disease. To reduce gaps in protection and provide the best protection against parvovirus during the first few months of life, a series of puppy vaccinations are administered. Puppies should receive a dose of canine parvovirus vaccine between 14 and 16 weeks of age, regardless of how many doses they received earlier, to develop adequate protection. To protect their adult dogs, pet owners should be sure that their dog's parvovirus vaccination is up-to-date. There are titers available that measure the dog's level of antibodies against the canine parvovirus, but the antibody level may not directly translate to protection if the dog is exposed to the virus. Ask your veterinarian about a recommended prevention program for your dog. Until a puppy has received its complete series of vaccinations, pet owners should use caution when bringing their pet to places where young puppies congregate (e.g. pet shops, parks, puppy classes, obedience classes, doggy daycare, kennels, and grooming establishments). Reputable establishments and training programs reduce exposure risk by requiring vaccinations, health examinations, good hygiene, and isolation of ill puppies and dogs. Contact with known infected dogs and their premises should always be avoided. In spite of proper vaccination, a small percentage of dogs do not develop protective immunity and remain susceptible to infection. Finally, do not let your puppy or adult dog to come into contact with the fecal waste of other dogs while walking or playing outdoors. Prompt and proper disposal of waste material is always advisable as a way to limit spread of canine parvovirus infection as well as other diseases that can infect humans and animals. Dogs with vomiting or diarrhea or other dogs which have been exposed to ill dogs should not be taken to kennels, show grounds, dog parks, or other areas where they will come into contact with other dogs. Similarly, unvaccinated dogs should not be exposed to ill dogs or those with unknown vaccination histories. People who are in contact with sick or exposed dogs should avoid handling of other dogs or at least wash their hands and change their clothes before doing so. The intestinal form of the virus has several major symptoms. The dog may have severe or bloody diarrhea, along with vomiting and fever. Because of this, the dog may begin to rapidly lose weight. The lack of appetite does not help the problem. Overall, your dog may feel lethargic all or most of the time. Your dog will be less likely to be able to absorb nutrients when it has CPV. Your dog may become weak and dehydrated from a lack of fluids and protein. Your dog’s heart might beat too rapidly, and the tissue may be very red. When your dog’s vet examines the abdominal area, your dog might feel discomfort or severe pain in the area. Fever is a possibility with CPV, but low body temperature is just as possible. You will want to keep your pet warm. The clinical signs and symptoms of CPV disease can vary, but generally they include severe vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea often has a very strong smell, may contain lots of mucus and may or may not contain blood. Additionally, affected dogs often exhibit a lack of appetite, marked listlessness and depression, and fever. It is important to note that many dogs may not show every clinical sign, but vomiting and diarrhea are the most common and consistent signs; vomiting usually begins first. Parvo may affect dogs of all ages, but is most common in unvaccinated dogs less than one year of age. Young puppies less than five months of age are usually the most severely affected, and the most difficult to treat. Any unvaccinated puppy that shows the symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea should be tested for CPV. The clinical signs of CPV infection can mimic many other diseases that cause vomiting and diarrhea; consequently, the diagnosis of CPV is often a challenge for the veterinarian. The positive confirmation of CPV infection requires the demonstration of the virus or virus antigen in the stool, or the detection of anti-CPV antibodies in the blood serum. There is a simple in-clinic test for CPV that will screen for this disease. Occasionally, a dog will have parvovirus but test negative for virus in the stool. Fortunately, this is an uncommon occurrence. A tentative diagnosis is often based on the presence of a reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) and clinical signs. If further confirmation is needed, stool or blood can be submitted to a veterinary laboratory for additional tests. The absence of leukopenia does not mean that the dog does not have CPV infection. Some dogs that become clinically ill may not have a low white blood cell count. The best method of protecting your dog against CPV infection is proper vaccination. Puppies receive a parvovirus vaccination as part of their multiple-agent vaccine series. It is recommended to be given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. In some high-risk situations, veterinarians will give the vaccine at two-week intervals, with an additional booster administered at 18 to 22 weeks of age. After the initial series of vaccinations, boosters will be required on a regular basis. If an approved three-year parvovirus vaccine was used, the next booster vaccine will be routinely administered in three years. Dogs in high exposure situations (i.e., kennels, dog shows, field trials, etc.) may be better protected with a booster every year. Pregnant females might be boostered with a killed parvovirus vaccine two to four weeks before whelping in order to transfer higher levels of protective antibodies to the puppies. You and your veterinarian should make the final decision together about the vaccination schedule that best fits your pet's lifestyle.","label":[[4,21,"DISEASE"],[23,26,"DISEASE"],[59,64,"DISEASE"],[271,279,"SYMPTOM"],[281,289,"SYMPTOM"],[291,302,"SYMPTOM"],[308,324,"SYMPTOM"],[626,631,"DISEASE"],[648,663,"SYMPTOM"],[665,673,"SYMPTOM"],[674,682,"SYMPTOM"],[683,688,"SYMPTOM"],[690,698,"SYMPTOM"],[699,717,"SYMPTOM"],[717,729,"SYMPTOM"],[874,879,"DISEASE"],[1236,1250,"SYMPTOM"],[1737,1742,"DISEASE"],[2212,2222,"DISEASE"],[2937,2942,"DISEASE"],[3166,3183,"DISEASE"],[3218,3223,"DISEASE"],[3719,3724,"DISEASE"],[3942,3952,"DISEASE"],[3961,3969,"SYMPTOM"],[3971,3987,"SYMPTOM"],[3989,4003,"SYMPTOM"],[4008,4016,"SYMPTOM"],[4018,4023,"SYMPTOM"],[4027,4047,"SYMPTOM"],[4049,4060,"SYMPTOM"],[4063,4071,"SYMPTOM"],[4077,4083,"SYMPTOM"],[4099,4107,"SYMPTOM"],[4768,4776,"SYMPTOM"],[4781,4789,"DISEASE"],[4909,4914,"DISEASE"],[5410,5420,"DISEASE"],[5791,5801,"DISEASE"],[6043,6053,"DISEASE"],[6274,6291,"DISEASE"],[6488,6498,"DISEASE"],[7779,7787,"SYMPTOM"],[7791,7799,"SYMPTOM"],[8328,8343,"SYMPTOM"],[8356,8364,"SYMPTOM"],[8369,8374,"SYMPTOM"],[8414,8433,"SYMPTOM"],[10454,10464,"DISEASE"],[11267,11277,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11,"text":"Pneumonia is a condition that can affect your pup's respiratory system, (including the lungs and airways), seriously interfering with your dog's ability to breathe normally. With treatment dogs generally recover well from pneumonia, but if the condition is left untreated symptoms may become severe and serious complications can develop. Infectious pneumonia (bacterial pneumonia) is the most common type of pneumonia in our four-legged friends. This form of pneumonia is caused by a viral or bacterial infection in the dog's respiratory system. Bordetella bronchiseptica is the bacteria most commonly linked to infectious pneumonia in dogs. This form of pneumonia is easily transmitted between dogs that are very young, very old or suffering from a compromised immune system. If your dog is suffering from bacterial infectious pneumonia you may notice some of the following symptoms: Breathing difficulties Coughing High fever Runny nose Difficulty exercising Nasal whistling or wheezing Irregular breathing Dehydration Lethargy Weight loss or loss of appetite. These symptoms should never be ignored. If you notice that your dog is displaying any of the symptoms listed above, contact your vet to schedule an examination for your dog. When you call to book an appointment let your vet know that you think your dog may have bacterial pneumonia since extra precautions may need to be taken at the vet's office to ensure that the infection doesn't spread to other pets. Aspiration pneumonia can occur if your pup accidentally inhales vomit or medication, has an abnormality of the pharynx, or a neuromuscular disorder that affects your dog's respiratory function. An enlargement of the lower esophagus due to frequent regurgitation (typically caused by acid reflux) can also lead to aspiration pneumonia in some cases, as can an incorrectly placed feeding tube. Common Signs of Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia are much the same as those listed for bacterial pneumonia and can include: Breathing difficulties Difficulty exercising Coughing High fever Runny nose Nasal whistling or wheezing Irregular breathing Dehydration Lethargy Weight loss or loss of appetite. Aspiration pneumonia can also lead to more unusual symptoms such as Difficulty swallowing Bluish skin Altered mood Frequent regurgitation. If your pooch shows any of the signs of aspiration pneumonia contact your vet right away to book an appointment for your pup. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent more severe issues from developing.Common medications prescribed by vets for the treatment of infectious bacterial or aspiration pneumonia in dogs include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for fever and pain, and bronchodilators and expectorants for coughing and breathing problems. In more severe cases hospitalization may be necessary to allow for more intensive treatments such as supplemental oxygen, intravenous antibiotics, or fluid therapy. Your vet will provide you with specific instructions for caring for your dog as they recover from pneumonia. Those instructions may  include: Restricting your dog's activities Keeping other pets and small children away in order for your dog to rest Supplying plenty of fresh water to help keep your pet hydrated Providing your dog with a steam treatment by running a hot shower while you sit with your dog in the bathroom.Aspiration pneumonia occurs when a dog breathes in substances like food or vomit. It is one of the more common types of pneumonia. The inhaled food material physically blocks air spaces and sets off an inflammatory cascade within the lungs. Stomach acids can also directly damage lung cells. All these factors combined create a perfect environment for a secondary bacterial infection. Some animals are at a higher risk for developing aspiration pneumonia due to factors such as: Laryngeal impairment Under sedation or anesthesia Neurologic disorders Medically required force-feeding Being prone to vomiting or regurgitation Brachycephalic breeds (Pugs, Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, etc.) Bacterial pneumonia is common in dogs. Bacteria typically enters the lungs through aspiration or inhalation, but rarely spreads throughout the bloodstream. Most healthy adult animals do not acquire primary bacterial pneumonia. Puppies, seniors and immunocompromised dogs are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia. Typically, this type of pneumonia is a secondary condition, or works in conjunction of a bigger respiratory issue involving multiple bacteria and viruses. Therapy depends on the type of pneumonia and underlying pathology, or other illnesses. The severity of the disease will also dictate the intensity of treatment. Mild cases of pneumonia can be managed on an outpatient basis with medications, rest and home care. Moderate to severe cases require hospitalization - often at emergency facilities - with 24\/7 nursing care and special equipment. Antibiotics Veterinarians prescribe antibiotics to dogs with primary or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Most common antibiotics include Doxycycline, Fluoroquinolone and Amoxicillin-clavulanic Acid. Treatment length is typically long-term, sometimes more than a month. Frequent rechecks help determine how long the antibiotics must be taken. Oxygen Therapy For animals who cannot oxygenate sufficiently on room-air, they are placed on supplemental oxygen. This may be a nasal or face mask, but veterinarians most commonly utilize an oxygen cage. An oxygen cage is an enclosed environment where the oxygen can be manipulated from room air (20 percent oxygen) to 100 percent oxygen. This is typically the least stressful way to supply oxygen to dogs in respiratory distress, and indicates the dog’s level of illness. Fluid Therapy Dogs with pneumonia are typically dehydrated and require an intravenous catheter and fluid therapy to rehydrate. Dehydration impairs respiratory clearance and function, so this is especially important in cases of pneumonia. Nebulization and Coupage Nebulizers create a fine mist and allow a localized increase in humidity, like the moist environment of a bathroom when the shower is on. Most nebulizers use saline to increase hydration of the airway but can also add antibiotics. After a nebulization treatment, dogs with pneumonia may have coupage performed, which is a gentle yet firm tap around the chest. Together, nebulization and coupage help break apart and clear mucus and other cells trapped in the airways. Ventilation Severe cases of pneumonia require full sedation and a ventilator to breathe. This is typically done if a dog does not respond to initial oxygen therapy or is minimally unresponsive. This typically happens only in an intensive care unit. Pulmonary edema, the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissue, airways, or air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, may occur along with circulatory disorders or in some allergic reactions or infectious diseases. Head trauma can cause pulmonary edema in dogs. Labored breathing, with an increased rate, and open-mouth breathing may occur. Animals stand or sit rather than lie down, or lie only on their breast bone. The veterinarian may be able to hear crackling noises, normal sounds, or a complete lack of breathing sounds in the chest. Oxygen supplementation can provide short-term relief, but treatment of the primary cause is also necessary. Medications called diuretics are typically used to remove excessive fluid from the lungs.","label":[[0,9,"DISEASE"],[222,231,"DISEASE"],[338,358,"DISEASE"],[360,379,"DISEASE"],[493,502,"DISEASE"],[828,837,"DISEASE"],[885,907,"SYMPTOM"],[908,916,"SYMPTOM"],[917,927,"SYMPTOM"],[928,938,"SYMPTOM"],[939,960,"SYMPTOM"],[961,976,"SYMPTOM"],[980,988,"SYMPTOM"],[989,1008,"SYMPTOM"],[1009,1020,"SYMPTOM"],[1021,1029,"SYMPTOM"],[1030,1041,"SYMPTOM"],[1045,1061,"SYMPTOM"],[1335,1344,"DISEASE"],[1480,1489,"DISEASE"],[1877,1897,"DISEASE"],[1977,1996,"DISEASE"],[2014,2036,"SYMPTOM"],[2037,2058,"SYMPTOM"],[2059,2067,"SYMPTOM"],[2068,2078,"SYMPTOM"],[2079,2089,"SYMPTOM"],[2090,2105,"SYMPTOM"],[2109,2117,"SYMPTOM"],[2118,2137,"SYMPTOM"],[2138,2149,"SYMPTOM"],[2150,2158,"SYMPTOM"],[2159,2170,"SYMPTOM"],[2173,2190,"SYMPTOM"],[2636,2645,"DISEASE"],[2767,2775,"SYMPTOM"],[2780,2798,"SYMPTOM"],[3063,3072,"DISEASE"],[3507,3516,"SYMPTOM"],[4413,4422,"DISEASE"],[4575,4584,"DISEASE"],[6860,6881,"DISEASE"],[6983,7000,"SYMPTOM"],[7010,7024,"SYMPTOM"],[7030,7050,"SYMPTOM"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12,"text":"A pyometra is an infection inside the womb. Any unneutered dog is at risk of developing a pyometra, especially if they are over six years old. Hormonal changes during a season\/heat put your dog at risk of a womb infection. Once the heat is over, the majority return to normal, but unfortunately, some dogs develop complications, which lead to an infection (pyometra). As a pyometra develops, the womb fills with pus. A pyometra can lead to blood poisoning, kidney failure, peritonitis and even death. We talk about a pyometra as either ‘open’ or ‘closed’. An open pyometra is when the womb entrance is open, meaning you are likely to see blood and pus coming from your dog’s vulva. A closed pyometra is when the womb entrance is shut; meaning you are unlikely to see any discharge. A closed pyometra is particularly dangerous because it is at risk of bursting. It’s very rare, but occasionally a neutered dog will develop a specific type of pyometra called a stump pyometra – read more below. Hormone therapy used to treat an unwanted pregnancy increases the chance of a pyometra. Symptoms of a pyometra usually begin four to eight weeks after a season, and include: Drinking more than usual Vomiting Pus leaking from vulva\/vagina Bloated abdomen (tummy) Panting and weakness Off food Weeing more than usual Collapse. Unneutered dogs that still have reproductive organs are more likely to get pyometra, especially when they are over age 6.  The chances of developing pyometra are higher when your unneutered dog is out of heat. During this time, the dog goes through hormonal changes. When the heat period is over, most dogs return to normal. But, some may develop an infection or pyometra in their uterus. As the infection grows, the uterus gets filled with pus. If not treated on time, the pus can cause blood poisoning, peritonitis, kidney failure, or even death. Pyometra can be 'open' or 'closed.' In an open pyometra, the uterus’ entry remains open, and you can see pus or blood coming out of your dog's vulva.  In closed pyometra, the uterus is shut, and you can't see the discharge. This condition is more dangerous as the uterus can burst. In rare cases, a dog may also develop a particular type of pyometra called a stump pyometra. It happens when a small uterus stump remains inside the dog and gets infected. The symptoms of pyometra in dogs usually start after four to eight weeks of a heat period. The common ones include: An increased urge for water  Nausea or vomiting A discharge from the vulva (pus) Bloated tummy Frequent panting  Fatigue Appetite changes Increased urination Unusual collapse. These signs can be the indication of other underlying medical conditions, as well. Keep an eye on your pet and seek medical attention as soon as you observe any change in their behavior. The vet will start the diagnosis of your dog's condition with questions about the heat cycle. You will need to tell the doctor about your dog's changing behavior and if she has been cleaning herself more around the vulva. The vet may first check any swelling in your dog's abdomen with radiographs or an ultrasound exam. The initial stage of pyometra usually comes with a slight vaginal discharge with no prominent symptoms. Pets diagnosed with pyometra later show visible signs. Dogs with pyometra also have an increased white blood cell count and globulins in the blood. Some dogs may also have painful, enlarged abdomen. The preferred pyometra in dogs treatment is surgery. The vet surgeon usually performs an ovariohysterectomy (spay) to remove the infected uterus and ovaries. This surgery is more complicated than routine spay. Dogs diagnosed in the early stages of their illness are considered good candidates for a successful surgery. The risks of complications and extended hospitalization are higher as the pyometra develops. After the surgery, typically, intravenous fluids (IV) are needed. Pyometra is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment. If you notice symptoms or changes in your dog's behavior, call your vet. Early diagnosis lowers the risks of complications. Pyometra is a secondary infection that occurs as a result of hormonal changes in the female's reproductive tract. Following estrus (heat), the hormone progesterone remains elevated for up to two months and causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur for several consecutive estrus cycles, the uterine lining continues to increase in thickness until cysts form within the uterine tissues (a condition called cystic endometrial hyperplasia). The thickened, cystic lining secretes fluids that create an ideal environment for bacterial growth. In addition, the muscles of the uterus cannot contract properly either due to thickening of the uterine wall or the high levels of the hormone progesterone. This means that bacteria that enters the uterus and fluids that have accumulated cannot be expelled.pyometra_dog_reproductive_organs_ventral_view_2018-1-01 During estrus, white blood cells, which would normally protect against infection by eliminating bacteria, are inhibited from entering the uterus. This normal occurrence allows sperm to safely enter the female's reproductive tract without being damaged or destroyed by these immune system cells. The clinical signs depend on whether or not the cervix remains open. If it is open, pus will drain from the uterus through the vagina to the outside. Pus or an abnormal discharge is often seen on the skin or hair under the tail or on bedding and furniture where the dog has recently laid. Fever, lethargy, anorexia, and depression may or may not be present. If the cervix is closed, pus that forms is not able to drain to the outside. It collects in the uterus ultimately causing the abdomen to distend. The bacteria release toxins that are absorbed into the bloodstream. Dogs with closed pyometra become severely ill very rapidly. They are anorectic, very listless and very depressed. Vomiting or diarrhea may also be present.dog_drinking_pyometra_2018-01 Toxins released by the bacteria affect the kidney's ability to retain fluid. Increased urine production occurs, and many dogs drink an excess of water to compensate. Increased water consumption may occur in both open- and closed-cervix pyometra. Dogs that are examined early in the course of the disease may have a slight vaginal discharge and show no other signs of illness. However, most dogs with pyometra are seen later in the illness. A very ill female dog with a history of recent heat that is drinking an increased amount of water should be suspected of having pyometra. This is especially true if there is a vaginal discharge or a painful, enlarged abdomen. \"A very ill female dog with a history of recent heat that is drinking an increased amount of water should be suspected of having pyometra.\" Dogs with pyometra usually have a severe elevation of the white blood cell count and often have an elevation of globulins (a type of protein often associated with the immune system) in the blood. The specific gravity (concentration) of the urine is generally low due to the toxic effects of the bacteria on the kidneys. However, these changes are non-specific and may be present in any dog with a major bacterial infection. If the cervix is closed, radiographs (X-rays) of the abdomen will often identify the enlarged uterus. If the cervix is open, there will often be such minimal uterine enlargement that the radiograph will be inconclusive. An ultrasound examination may be helpful in identifying an enlarged uterus and differentiating that from a normal pregnancy. Ultrasound changes that indicate pyometra include increased uterine size, thickened uterine walls, and fluid accumulation within the uterus.","label":[[2,10,"DISEASE"],[357,365,"DISEASE"],[373,381,"DISEASE"],[691,699,"DISEASE"],[791,799,"DISEASE"],[959,973,"DISEASE"],[1167,1192,"SYMPTOM"],[1192,1200,"SYMPTOM"],[1201,1230,"SYMPTOM"],[1231,1246,"SYMPTOM"],[1393,1401,"DISEASE"],[1467,1475,"DISEASE"],[1681,1689,"DISEASE"],[2440,2464,"SYMPTOM"],[2466,2472,"SYMPTOM"],[2476,2484,"SYMPTOM"],[2518,2531,"SYMPTOM"],[2532,2549,"SYMPTOM"],[2575,2594,"SYMPTOM"],[3142,3150,"DISEASE"],[3397,3404,"SYMPTOM"],[3406,3422,"SYMPTOM"],[3817,3825,"DISEASE"],[3902,3910,"DISEASE"],[4090,4098,"DISEASE"],[4554,4584,"DISEASE"],[5584,5589,"SYMPTOM"],[5591,5599,"SYMPTOM"],[5601,5609,"SYMPTOM"],[5615,5625,"SYMPTOM"],[5981,5989,"SYMPTOM"],[5993,6001,"SYMPTOM"],[6452,6460,"DISEASE"],[6620,6628,"DISEASE"]],"Comments":[]}
